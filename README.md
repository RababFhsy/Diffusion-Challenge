ðŸ¤— Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether you're looking for a simple inference solution or training your own diffusion models, ðŸ¤— Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction).
## Installation
We highly recommend installingðŸ¤—the following dependencies and scripts to successfully run DreamBooth with the Diffusers library. These installations will provide you with the necessary tools to work with control nets, diffusion models, transformers, and accelerate the training and inference processes during running this project.
