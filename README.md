ðŸ¤— Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether you're looking for a simple inference solution or training your own diffusion models, ðŸ¤— Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction).
## Installation
We highly recommend installingðŸ¤—the following dependencies and scripts to successfully run DreamBooth with the Diffusers library. These installations will provide you with the necessary tools to work with control nets, diffusion models, transformers, and accelerate the training and inference processes during running this project.

### This line downloads the train_dreambooth.py script from a GitHub repository. The -q flag is used to suppress the output of the wget command.

!wget -q :
    
```bash
!wget -q https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/raw/main/examples/dreambooth/train_dreambooth.py
```
 ### This line downloads the convert_diffusers_to_original_stable_diffusion.py script from another GitHub :
 ```bash
!wget -q https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/raw/main/scripts/convert_diffusers_to_original_stable_diffusion.py
```
 ### This line installs the diffusers package from the specified GitHub repository using pip. The -qq flag is used to suppress the output of the pip command:
  ```bash
  %pip install -qq git+https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers

```
### This line installs the triton package using pip. The -q flag is used to suppress the output of the pip command. The -U flag is used to upgrade the package to the latest version, and --pre is used to install pre-release versions if available:
 ```bash
%pip install -q -U --pre triton
```
### This line installs multiple packages (accelerate, transformers, ftfy, bitsandbytes, gradio, natsort, safetensors, xformers) using pip. The -q flag is used to suppress the output of the pip command.
 ```bash
%pip install -q accelerate transformers ftfy bitsandbytes==0.35.0 gradio natsort safetensors xformers
```
### This command installs the controlnet_aux package. It is likely a package that provides auxiliary functionality or utilities for working with control nets in deep learning models.
 ```bash
pip install controlnet_aux
```
### This command installs three packages: diffusers, transformers, and accelerate.
diffusers: is a package that provides implementations of diffusion models, which are probabilistic generative models.
transformers: is a popular package for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing pre-trained models, tokenizers, and other utilities.
accelerate: is a library that provides tools for accelerating PyTorch training and inference, such as distributed training and mixed precision.
 ```bash
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate
```
###This command installs the xformers package. It is likely a package that provides additional functionalities or enhancements for working with transformers in deep learning models.
 ```bash
pip install xformers
```
### This command installs the torch and torchvision packages. torch is the main PyTorch library for deep learning, providing tensor computations and neural network operations. torchvision is a package that provides utilities for computer vision tasks, such as image transformations and pre-trained models.
 ```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```
### This command installs the diffusers package, which was already mentioned above. It provides implementations of diffusion models for generative modeling tasks.
 ```bash
pip install diffusers
```
### This command installs the transformers package, which was already explained above. It is a popular package for NLP tasks, offering pre-trained models and other NLP utilities.
 ```bash
pip install transformers
```
### This command installs the accelerate package using the ! syntax, which is used specifically in Jupyter Notebook or IPython to run shell commands. It is likely installing the same accelerate package mentioned earlier.
 ```bash
!pip install accelerate
```
