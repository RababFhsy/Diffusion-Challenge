# Diffusion-Challenge



ðŸ¤—The Moroccan Djellaba is a symbolic element of the Moroccan Culture. It remains deeply rooted in the daily life of Moroccan women. She wears it during traditional celebrations and even in their daily routines. However, she faces constraints when choosing a Djellaba and staying in trend.To make this easier for them, we proposed a solution: "Vestiaire_Meghribi_Intelligent" based basically on Stable Diffusion.
# Features

## Stable diffussion
In our project, we used stable diffusion to personalize the text-to-image model for Moroccan dress products used for fashion, specifically the Djellaba. By leveraging stable diffusion, we were able to enhance the model's ability to generate images that accurately reflect the unique features of the Djellaba, including its design, color, and cultural significance.
## DataSet
In this project  we gathered our dataset by scraping a fashion website named Diamontic.in this case we used web scraping to collect images and related information of fashion products from the Diamontic website. This dataset will be used for training and testing our machine learning models to classify fashion products based on their attributes such as color, pattern, and style.
## FineTuning
In our project, we used FineTuning to adapt a pre-trained convolutional neural network for a new fashion classification task. Our goal was to train the model to recognize a traditional Moroccan dress, the djellaba, based on a given input image and provide specific size information. We collected a dataset of images of djellabas in various sizes and used transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained model to recognize the unique features of the garment. During the fine-tuning process.
## Training
Training process: During the training process, the stable diffusion model is repeatedly presented with batches of training data, and the model's weights are updated to minimize the loss function. The training process typically involves a large number of iterations, with each iteration taking a batch of input images and generating corresponding output images.
## Inference
we used inference to evaluate the model's accuracy on a validation set and made adjustments to the model based on the evaluation results. Despite having limited training data, we were able to achieve high accuracy on the djellaba recognition task, and the model was able to provide accurate size information based on the input image.
## ControlNet onepose
During our project, we utilized the ControlNet OnePose deep learning architecture to estimate the pose of a model in a given image. ControlNet OnePose is a specific implementation of the ControlNet architecture that is designed for single-pose estimation. Using OnePose, we were able to predict the 2D keypoint locations of the model in the image, as well as the corresponding 3D keypoint locations in a predefined coordinate system. By estimating the model's pose, we were able to extract important features such as the model's position, orientation, and body proportions from the image.
# Problems
### Data preparation:
This typically involves collecting and cleaning a large dataset of images that will be used to train the model.
### hardware environment:
The problem of limited resources concerning our hardware environment, especially GPU and RAM, refers to the constraints and limitations we faced when it comes to the available computational power and memory in our hardware setup.
